# Ruisseau de lune - front-end

This is the front-end repository of my first group project with real clients.

# Project

This website is for an association who works with young children and their parents to introduce them to music. They wanted the website to present the association and show their news, activities and members. They also needed an administrator page to be able to manage this content : create, update or delete an article and add images or videos.
They asked for a simple design with pastel colors from childhood, and a homepage with a soft animation.
Since they are not confortable with a computer we decided the admin part would be a simple form changing with their choices.
(for example the form would not be the same if they choose "modifying" or "create").

# Tools

We begun with Figma to do our wireframe, then the project was developped with React. We used React Context to provide states to different components, React Router for the navigation and Axios for fetching data.
As usual Eslint and Prettier helped us for the formatting.
